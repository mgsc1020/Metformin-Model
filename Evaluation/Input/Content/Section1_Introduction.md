The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for metformin in healthy adults.

The herein presented model represents an update of the metformin model published by Hanke et al. ([Hanke 2020](#5-references)).  

Metformin is widely used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is a highly hydrophilic compound, positively
charged at physiological pH and depends on active transport for its absorption, distribution and excretion. The absorption of metformin is saturable and reported to be restricted to the upper intestine ([Vidon 1988](#5-references)). The excretion of metformin is mainly mediated via the sequential action of OCT2 and MATE in the kidney, with a moderate contribution of renal glomerular filtration (approximately 20 %). Metformin is recommended by the FDA as OCT2/MATE victim drug for the use in clinical DDI studies and drug labeling ([FDA 2017](#5-references)).

The herein presented PBPK model of metformin PBPK model has been developed and evaluated by comparing simulations to observed data of both intravenously and orally administered metformin covering a dosing range from 0.001 to 2550 mg.

The presented model includes the following features:

- transport by PMAT,
- transport by OCT1,
- transport by OCT2,
- transport by MATE,
- renal clearance by glomerular filtration,
- oral absorption with dissolution rate assigned to a Weibull function.
